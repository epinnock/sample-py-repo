# CodeAnalyzer: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

The `CodeAnalyzer` is a sophisticated tool designed to parse and analyze Python codebases, providing insights into the structure, dependencies, and usage of code elements such as classes, functions, and variables. This tool is particularly useful for developers looking to understand, refactor, or optimize large codebases by visualizing relationships and tracking definitions and usages across files.

## Imports and Dependencies

- `ast`: Provides tools for processing Python abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
- `os`: Offers functions for interacting with the operating system, used here for file path manipulations.
- `defaultdict`: From the `collections` module, used for creating dictionaries with default values.
- `networkx`: A powerful library for creating and manipulating graphs, used to represent code dependencies.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Enables the visualization of graphs generated by `networkx`.

## Code Structure Overview

The file is structured around a main class `CodeAnalyzer` and several functions that facilitate the analysis of individual files and entire projects. The class uses Python's `ast` module to parse code into an AST and then traverses this tree to collect data on definitions and usages of code elements.

## Class: CodeAnalyzer

### API Explanation

**Purpose:**
- Parses and analyzes Python code to track definitions and usages of classes, functions, and variables.

**Methods:**
- `__init__()`: Initializes data structures to store definitions and usages.
- `visit_FunctionDef(node)`: Handles function definitions.
- `visit_ClassDef(node)`: Handles class definitions.
- `visit_Assign(node)`: Handles variable assignments.
- `visit_Name(node)`: Tracks variable usages.
- `visit_Call(node)`: Tracks function and method calls.
- `get_context()`: Determines the current context (class or function) for usage tracking.

### Internal Workings

The class uses the visitor pattern provided by `ast.NodeVisitor` to traverse the AST. It maintains context information to accurately record where definitions and usages occur.

```python
class CodeAnalyzer(ast.NodeVisitor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.definitions = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(set))
        self.usages = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list))
        self.current_file = ""
        self.current_class = None
        self.current_function = None
```

## Function: analyze_file

### API Explanation

**Purpose:**
- Analyzes a single Python file to find definitions and usages.

**Parameters:**
- `file_path (str)`: The path to the file to analyze.
- `relative_path (str)`: The relative path of the file within the project.

**Returns:**
- `Tuple[defaultdict, defaultdict]`: Dictionaries containing definitions and usages.

### Example

```python
definitions, usages = analyze_file('path/to/file.py', 'relative/path/to/file.py')
```

## Function: analyze_project

### API Explanation

**Purpose:**
- Recursively analyzes all Python files in a project directory.

**Parameters:**
- `project_path (str)`: The root directory of the project.

**Returns:**
- `defaultdict`: A dictionary containing aggregated definitions and usages across the project.

### Example

```python
project_analysis = analyze_project('./sample_project')
```

## Function: create_graph

### API Explanation

**Purpose:**
- Creates a directed graph representing the code structure and dependencies.

**Parameters:**
- `analysis (dict)`: The analysis data containing definitions and usages.

**Returns:**
- `networkx.DiGraph`: A graph representing the code structure.

### Example

```python
G = create_graph(project_analysis)
```

## Function: visualize_graph

### API Explanation

**Purpose:**
- Visualizes the graph created by `create_graph` using `matplotlib`.

**Parameters:**
- `G (networkx.DiGraph)`: The graph to visualize.

### Example

```python
visualize_graph(G)
```

## Usage Examples

### Setup

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install ast os collections networkx matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the analysis:
   ```python
   project_path = './sample_project'
   analysis = analyze_project(project_path)
   G = create_graph(analysis)
   visualize_graph(G)
   ```

### Common Use Cases

- Understanding the structure of a large codebase.
- Identifying dependencies and potential refactoring points.
- Visualizing how different parts of the code interact.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

The tool is designed to handle typical Python code but may encounter issues with:
- Syntax errors in the code being analyzed.
- Extremely large codebases that may strain memory or processing power.

## Performance Considerations

- The tool may become slow with very large projects. Consider optimizing or distributing the analysis for such cases.
- Graph creation and visualization can be resource-intensive; use appropriate hardware or limit the scope of analysis.

## Testing and Debugging

- Unit tests should cover each method in `CodeAnalyzer` and each function.
- Use logging to trace the analysis process and debug issues.

## Configuration and Customization

- The tool can be extended to track additional code elements or metadata.
- Visualization options can be customized through `matplotlib` settings.

## Role in the Overall Architecture

`CodeAnalyzer` is a critical component for understanding and maintaining large Python projects, providing insights that can guide refactoring, optimization, and documentation efforts.

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

- The tool currently does not handle dynamic code execution or imports well.
- Future improvements could include support for multi-threading or distributed processing for larger projects.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors should:
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes.

## Major Updates and Documentation

- **Version 1.0**: Initial release with basic analysis and visualization capabilities.

## Summary

The `CodeAnalyzer` is a powerful tool for developers working with Python codebases, offering deep insights into code structure, dependencies, and usage patterns. By following this guide, developers can effectively utilize and extend this tool to meet their specific needs.
