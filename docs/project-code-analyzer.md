# CodeAnalyzer: Python Code Analysis Tool

## Introduction
The `CodeAnalyzer` is a Python tool designed to analyze and visualize the structure and dependencies of a Python project. It uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to parse Python files, tracking definitions and usages of classes, functions, and variables. This tool is particularly useful for understanding the interdependencies within a codebase and for code refactoring.

## Overview
The `CodeAnalyzer` tool provides a comprehensive analysis of a Python project by parsing each file and constructing a graph of dependencies. It identifies definitions and usages of various code elements such as classes, functions, and variables, and visualizes these relationships using a directed graph.

## Dependencies
- `ast`: Python's Abstract Syntax Tree module for parsing Python source code.
- `os`: Standard library for interacting with the operating system.
- `collections`: Standard library for specialized container datatypes.
- `networkx`: A Python package for creating and manipulating complex networks.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several main components:
- `CodeAnalyzer` class: A subclass of `ast.NodeVisitor` that visits nodes in the AST to collect definitions and usages.
- `analyze_file` function: Parses a single Python file and returns its definitions and usages.
- `analyze_project` function: Recursively analyzes all Python files in a project directory.
- `create_graph` function: Constructs a `networkx` graph from the project analysis.
- `visualize_graph` function: Uses `matplotlib` to visualize the graph.

## Key Components
### CodeAnalyzer Class
The `CodeAnalyzer` class is the core of the tool, responsible for visiting nodes in the AST and collecting data on definitions and usages. Key methods include:
- `visit_FunctionDef`: Tracks function definitions.
- `visit_ClassDef`: Tracks class definitions.
- `visit_Assign`: Tracks variable assignments.
- `visit_Name`: Tracks variable usages.
- `visit_Call`: Tracks function and method calls.

### analyze_file Function
```python
def analyze_file(file_path, relative_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    tree = ast.parse(content)
    analyzer = CodeAnalyzer()
    analyzer.current_file = relative_path
    analyzer.visit(tree)
    return analyzer.definitions, analyzer.usages
```

### analyze_project Function
```python
def analyze_project(project_path):
    project_analysis = {
        'definitions': defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(set)),
        'usages': defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list))
    }

    for root, _, files in os.walk(project_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                full_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                relative_path = os.path.relpath(full_path, project_path)
                definitions, usages = analyze_file(full_path, relative_path)
                for def_type, def_dict in definitions.items():
                    for name, locations in def_dict.items():
                        project_analysis['definitions'][def_type][name].update(locations)
                for usage_type, usage_dict in usages.items():
                    for name, locations in usage_dict.items():
                        project_analysis['usages'][usage_type][name].extend(locations)

    return project_analysis
```

## Usage
To use the `CodeAnalyzer`, follow these steps:
1. Set the `project_path` variable to the root directory of your Python project.
2. Call the `analyze_project` function with the project path.
3. Create a graph using the `create_graph` function.
4. Visualize the graph using the `visualize_graph` function.

Example:
```python
project_path = './sample_project'
analysis = analyze_project(project_path)
G = create_graph(analysis)
visualize_graph(G)
```

## Algorithms and Data Structures
The tool uses the following algorithms and data structures:
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Parses Python code into a tree structure representing the code's syntax.
- **Directed Graph**: Represents dependencies between code elements using `networkx`.

## System Integration
The `CodeAnalyzer` can be integrated into a larger development workflow to provide insights into code dependencies and structure. It can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into a CI/CD pipeline for automated code analysis.

## Performance and Limitations
- **Performance**: The tool's performance depends on the size of the project. Large projects may take longer to analyze.
- **Limitations**: The tool currently does not support analyzing Python code within compiled extensions or Cython code.

## Testing and Debugging
The tool can be tested by running it on a sample project and verifying the output graph. Debugging can be done by inspecting the intermediate data structures (`definitions` and `usages`) and the constructed graph.

## Configuration Options
There are no specific configuration options for the tool itself, but users can modify the `project_path` variable to analyze different projects.

## Conclusion
The `CodeAnalyzer` is a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing the structure and dependencies of a Python project. By providing insights into code elements and their relationships, it aids in code refactoring and maintenance.
