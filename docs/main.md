## Imports and Dependencies

This file has no external imports or dependencies, making it a standalone example that requires only a Python interpreter to run.

## Code Structure Overview

The file consists of a single function, `hello_world`, which encapsulates the entire functionality of the script.

## Function: `hello_world`

### API Explanation

```python
def hello_world():
    """
    Prints a greeting message to the console.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None

    Exceptions:
    None
    """
```

### Internal Workings

The `hello_world` function initializes a string variable `message` with the value "Hello Worlds". It then prints this message to the console followed by the string "End".

### Code Snippet

```python
def hello_world():
    message = "Hello Worlds"
    print(message)
    print("End")
```

### Algorithm and Data Structures

The function uses a simple string data structure to store the greeting message. The algorithm involves assigning the string to a variable and then printing it twice using the `print` function.

### Interactions

Since this is a standalone function with no dependencies, it interacts directly with the standard output (console) via the `print` function.

## Workflow and Control Flow

The control flow of the script is straightforward:

1. The `hello_world` function is defined.
2. Inside the function, a string `message` is assigned.
3. The `message` is printed.
4. The string "End" is printed.

## Usage Examples

To run the script, simply execute the file using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python hello_world.py
```

Expected output:

```
Hello Worlds
End
```

## Error Handling

Given the simplicity of the script, there are no specific error handling mechanisms implemented. However, common runtime errors such as issues with the Python interpreter or console output could occur, which are outside the scope of this simple example.

## Performance Considerations

The script is extremely lightweight and performs minimal operations, making performance considerations irrelevant for this example.

## Testing and Debugging

Manual testing can be performed by running the script and verifying the console output. No additional debugging tools or techniques are necessary due to the script's simplicity.

## Known Limitations

- The script is purely illustrative and does not handle any input or perform complex operations.
- It does not demonstrate advanced Python features or best practices beyond basic syntax.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to enhance this example are welcome. Suggestions could include adding comments, improving variable names, or extending the functionality to introduce additional Python concepts.

## Summary

The `hello_world.py` file is a foundational example in Python, showcasing basic syntax and the use of the `print` function. It serves as a starting point for beginners and a quick reference for more experienced developers.

## Major Updates
